            I'm a product manager trying to genuinely understand AI — not just the surface layer.
            Every resource I found was either too technical or too vague. So I built the thing I
            wished existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            FactorBeam is a personal playbook made public. Every concept is written for people who
            think in products, not models. The highlight-to-explain feature exists because I kept
            getting stuck on single sentences.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is free, always. I'm learning in public. If it helps you too, that's the whole
            point.
